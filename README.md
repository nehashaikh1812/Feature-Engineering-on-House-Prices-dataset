# Feature-Engineering-on-House-Prices-dataset

The House Prices dataset describes sale of residential properties in Ames, Iowa during the years 2006-2010. I have trained a linear regression model to predict the house prices, an effort to study how the independent variables affect the target variable (in this case, the house price). I started with some exploratory data analysis followed by missing-values imputation, encoding of categorical variables and feature scaling, all encompassed in a feature engineering pipeline. The Jupyter NoteBook that I have uploaded is quite self-explanatory. The end result is a linear regression model that predicts house prices with an accuracy of 86.7%
